# druid_table

A table widget for druid ( the rust widget library). WIP.

* Virtualized rows and columns, ie data does not have to reside in memory and there is nothing stored per row/column/cell (if fixed sizes are used).
* Custom cell and header rendering
* Columnns can be static or data derived
* Selections (single cell right now)

Requires my own druid fork currently.
